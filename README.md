AQA-Preliminary

Preliminary for AQA's AS Computing Exam for Unit 1, 2014

This is poached from the original code, and should be nessasary to post:

'Skeleton Program code for the AQA COMP1 Summer 2014 examination
'this code should be used in conjunction with the Preliminary Material
'written by the AQA COMP1 Programmer Team
'developed in the Visual Studio 2008 (Console Mode) programming environment (VB.NET)

For god's sake, why did my college decide to use VB instead of a significant programming language.
